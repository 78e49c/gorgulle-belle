# Görgülle Belle Application

This report presents an analysis of a language learning application developed using Android Studio with Kotlin Compose. The application employs unconventional methods to facilitate language learning, acknowledging the extensive interest and research in this field by many brilliant minds worldwide. It aims to differentiate itself by incorporating unique approaches to make language acquisition engaging, flexible, well-defined, and experience-oriented.

## Expectations

The primary goal of this application is to provide a novel way of learning languages that addresses various user needs and preferences. The following are the core expectations from the application:

1. **Engagement:** The application should be fun and engaging, catering to users who might not have the patience for traditional, tedious learning methods.

2. **Flexibility:** It should allow users to learn at their own pace and ability, similar to acquiring "street English" where the goal is practical communication rather than perfect grammar.

3. **Well-Defined Structure:** The application should encourage users to strive for improvement by setting clear goals and minimizing distractions, ensuring users remain focused and productive.

4. **Experience-Oriented Learning:** The application should take into account how the human brain works, focusing on experiential learning to make the process more effective.

## Project Description

The language learning application is designed with the above expectations in mind and employs two main methodologies:

### Primary Method: Utilizing Large Language Models

The core functionality of the application involves guiding users through exercises using system prompts to interact with large language models (LLMs). Unlike general conversational AI like ChatGPT, this application focuses on structured, goal-oriented interactions. For example, a user might be tasked with convincing a friend in English to visit Damascus, simulating real-life scenarios to practice language skills. The emphasis here is on achieving meaningful communication regardless of language proficiency, allowing users to practice language in context-specific situations.

### Short, Disjointed Sessions

These sessions are designed to be brief and varied, providing users with numerous opportunities to practice different aspects of the language. Tasks might include convincing a friend to visit a specific location or discussing particular topics, which, while not precisely measurable, help in achieving practical language use.

### Secondary Method: Applied Learning Principles

The second part of the application focuses on practical exercises that align with the outlined learning principles. This involves a test format with multiple-choice questions, where each choice has varying degrees of correctness and corresponding positive or negative points. This format acknowledges the spectrum of correctness and incorporates humor and flexibility in evaluation.

### Test Format and Reaction Concepts

One notable example is the reaction concept test format. Here, users respond to phrases in a foreign language with appropriate reactions such as "smile," "leave," etc. This approach offers a broad and forgiving evaluation, recognizing the utility of even a limited understanding and promoting a positive, inclusive learning environment.
